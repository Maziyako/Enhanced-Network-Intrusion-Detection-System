# Enhanced-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
This project is a Python-based Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors network traffic to detect potential security threats, such as port scanning and SYN flood attacks. Using Scapy, it captures packets in real-time and applies detection algorithms to alert for suspicious activities.
